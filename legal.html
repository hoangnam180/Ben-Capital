Frozen funds may only be sent back to the issuing gateway. The global freeze feature allows a gateway to freeze all balances it issues. The gateway may still issue payments. Accounts holding frozen balances may return the funds to the gateway. This feature is useful for migrating users from one account to another and to safeguard users in the event that the gateway account is compromised. The individual freeze is primarily intended for compliance with regulatory requirements, which may vary from one jurisdiction to another. It also allows gateways to freeze individual accounts issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity. These features allow gateways to better operate in compliance with laws and regulations.

                        </h5>
                        <h4 class="color-title">Risks
                        </h4>
                        <p class="contact__description">The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Such price fluctuations may increase or decrease the value of your assets at any given moment. Any currency – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.

                        </p>
                        <p class="contact__description">Virtual Asset and Digital Asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies, goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are a unique type of asset, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can issue more cryptocurrency or take corrective measures to protect the value of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets in a crisis.

                        </p>
                        <p class="contact__description">
                            Instead, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated global system of cryptocurrency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.
                        </p>
                        <p class="contact__description">The trading of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets is often susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence in Virtual Assets and Digital Assets might collapse because of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.
                        </p>
                        <p class="contact__description">There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.
                            You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Virtual Assets or Digital Assets.

                        <p class="contact__description">We use our banking providers in order to facilitate the receipt of fiat currency from Members and payments to other Members. Our banking providers DO NOT transfer, exchange or provide any services in connection with Virtual Assets or Digital Assets. Your fiat currency will be held in a bank account in the name of Ben Capital together with other Members' fiat currency. Where possible in a relevant jurisdiction which recognises the concept of a client account, we will notify the relevant banking provider that the bank account is a client account in which we hold fiat currency on behalf of Members. You will, in any event, remain the beneficial owner of the fiat currency that we hold on your behalf. We will maintain detailed records of all fiat currency held on behalf of Members. Whilst Ben Capital uses reasonable care in the appointment of its banking providers, in the event of a banking provider becoming insolvent or entering into an insolvency process in a relevant jurisdiction, Ben Capital may have only an unsecured claim against the banking provider, and Members’ fiat currency balances may be at risk subject to any protections provided at law in the relevant jurisdiction.

                        <p class="contact__description">We engage with third-party custodians in order to hold Virtual Assets and Digital Assets on your behalf. Your Virtual Assets and Digital Assets will be held on your behalf in a wallet in the name of Ben Capital together with other Members’ Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets. They may also from time to time be held in the wallet together with Ben Capital’s Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets which reflect Ben Capital’s fees, but which are recorded on Ben Capital’s ledger as belonging to Ben Capital, and which you instruct Ben Capital to collect by withdrawing them from the wallet. We will maintain detailed records of all Virtual Assets and Digital Assets which Members hold with third-party custodians appointed by us.
                            As set out above, Ben Capital will act only on your Instructions in respect of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets, and does not otherwise acquire any right, title or interest in them. Whilst Ben Capital uses reasonable care in the appointment of third-party custodians, in the event of a third-party custodian becoming insolvent or entering into an insolvency process in a relevant jurisdiction, you may have only an unsecured claim against the third-party custodian, and Members' Virtual Assets or Digital Assets may be at risk subject to any protections provided at law in the relevant jurisdiction.

                        <p>You are fully responsible for any mistakes, errors or defects which may arise in the course of any transaction that leads to partial or complete loss of your Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets. Ben Capital shall not be liable for any damages resulting from any actions previously described. Ben Capital shall in no case be liable for any loss, including, but not limited to, transfers between addresses, transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting from your improper actions or activities, or erroneous transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting in your Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets being lost. Ben Capital shall not compensate you for any losses resulting from such actions or activities.
                        </p>
                        <p class="contact__description">Ben Capital may provide, in certain circumstances, an investigation and possible recovery of the lost Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets as a payable service. Therefore, Ben Capital may, upon the request of a Member, utilize its best efforts to attempt to return misdirected Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets to the Member. Requests for transaction recovery shall be sent to support@bencapital.com. After receiving the transaction recovery request, Ben Capital will make a preliminary assessment for each transaction and reserves the right to refuse the recovery of a particular transaction.

                        </p>
                         <p class="contact__description">Ben Capital will charge an investigation fee for any such investigation. The fee shall amount to 10% of the value of lost Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets, but in no case less than 100.00 USD/EUR/GBP. The fee will be charged and shall be paid by the Member in Digital Assets or Virtual Assets which are subject to the transaction recovery. Ben Capital may investigate transactions that occurred not more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the request for the recovery of Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets. Ben Capital will not attempt to recover transactions with the value below 100.00 USD/EUR/GBP. Due to the specifics and case-by-case nature, Ben Capital does not, in any way, guarantee success and shall not be liable if the investigation is ineffective or unsuccessful, nor can Ben Capital provide the exact timing for such investigations, but will strive to provide feedback within a reasonable time.
